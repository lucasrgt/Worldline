# Changelog

All notable Worldline changes are recorded here. The project follows semantic
versioning for declared stable contracts; experimental adapter APIs may change
before they are promoted.

## 0.0.1 - Controlled Tick

Status: GO.

Stable milestone contract:

- freeze and hash the official Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 client artifact;
- pin and verify the RetroMCP toolchain;
- reconstruct and compile the mapped client locally;
- boot the real client object graph without a native window;
- load a deterministic in-memory world;
- advance exactly one externally requested `Minecraft.runTick()`;
- match an independent oracle compiled against the official client JAR in two
  fresh subject and two fresh oracle JVMs.

The frozen first-tick signature is
`ac13115a73408c85eb80b931dc3004b4fd66b26a5512e8d4fb036eebf70ae780`.

Release qualification includes two cold RetroMCP reconstructions. Decompiled
`World` source was not byte-stable, so v0.0.1 explicitly guarantees frozen
inputs and oracle-verified observable behavior, not byte-identical decompiler
output.

Experimental capabilities shipped alongside the milestone include a reusable
b1.7.3 adapter, 16-tick state traces, deterministic external boundaries,
replay-backed checkpoints, hypothesis branches, semantic inventory GUI
actions, and isolated mod-JAR loading. These do not enlarge the stable v0.0.1
contract.
