# Worldline Architecture

This document defines the smallest architecture that can grow toward a
controlled Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 runtime without mixing the public driver,
runtime policy, and game-specific integration.

## Current slice

```text
caller
  |
  v
worldline-api        public lifecycle contract and value types
  ^
  |
worldline-kernel     lifecycle policy and the backend integration port
  |
  v
b173 adapter         mapped game-specific implementation and lab controls

worldline-trace      independent canonical observation protocol
  ^            ^
  |            |
subject        official-JAR oracle
```

The modules are physical source roots and are compiled separately. The API is
compiled with no product classpath. The kernel is compiled with only the API on
its classpath. This makes the declared dependency direction executable rather
than conventional.

### `api`

Owns stable concepts visible to a scenario author. It must not expose RetroMCP,
LWJGL, mappings, instrumentation, or decompiled Minecraft types.

### `kernel`

Owns control-flow policy: valid lifecycle transitions and the narrow backend
port that each Minecraft integration must implement. It must not claim that
a transition succeeded unless the backend call completed.

Kernel unit tests use a recording fake. The server smoke supplies a test-scoped
`VanillaWorldBackend` for direct world-level evidence. The client cycles use the
reusable `B173Runtime` adapter, which constructs the original client tick object
graph and reaches `Minecraft.runTick()` through the same port. The adapter has
its own enforced source budget and compiles against local, ignored Minecraft
classes; no game binary or decompiled source enters the repository.

### `trace`

Owns the versioned canonical trace grammar, input validation, SHA-256 signature,
and output framing shared by a subject and its oracle. It has no dependencies
on the API, kernel, RetroMCP, or Minecraft. Adapters collect observations; the
trace module only serializes supplied values and therefore cannot make both
sides agree on game behavior by itself.

## Artifact and toolchain provenance

`artifacts/` contains public descriptors, never game binaries. The b1.7.3
descriptor freezes Mojang's byte length and SHA-1 plus the observed SHA-256.
Runtime verification accepts only the matching local JAR under the ignored
`local/artifacts/` root.

`toolchains/` pins external open-source tooling by repository and immutable Git
revision. Bootstrap checkouts and builds live under `local/toolchains/`; no
RetroMCP source is vendored into Worldline.

## First executable vanilla smokes

`smokes/deterministic-world-tick/` compiles a deterministic in-memory save/chunk
fixture and a `GameBackend` adapter against the mapped vanilla server classes
produced by RetroMCP. Its driver uses the public `MinecraftRuntime` interface;
the kernel enforces lifecycle policy before the adapter reaches `World.tick()`.
The same eight-tick fixture is independently compiled against and executed by
the official obfuscated server JAR. Two headless JVMs on each side must be
internally deterministic, byte-identical across the boundary, and match the
committed SHA-256 signature. Both sides depend on `worldline-trace` for the
canonical `v1` format, removing duplicated protocol and hashing code without
sharing their Minecraft access paths.

This establishes controlled vanilla `World.tick()` execution and differential
equivalence for one narrow observed fixture.

`smokes/controlled-client-tick/` completes the client-level cycle. It invokes
the original `Minecraft` constructor, installs explicit headless boundaries,
loads an original client `World`, and executes exactly one externally requested
`Minecraft.runTick()`. Its independent oracle uses official client names and
the frozen official JAR. The runner checks class origins, bytecode call paths,
four-process determinism, cross-boundary equality, and a frozen trace. The exact
scope and non-claims are normative in that smoke's `MAP.md`.

## Adapter direction

Game-specific work will enter through new adapter modules, not through the API
or by placing implementation in the harness:

```text
scenario/driver -> kernel -> backend port <- retromcp/lwjgl adapter
                         |
                         +-> trace/oracle observers
```

An adapter may depend on the API and kernel. The API and kernel must never
depend on an adapter. The reusable client adapter is an executable proof of
this direction. Replay-backed checkpoints, branch comparison, semantic GUI
control, and the narrow mod API remain adapter-side because their implementation
necessarily knows b1.7.3.

## Compatibility boundary

Product modules currently compile with `--release 8`; tooling runs on JDK 21.
This keeps the host harness modern while avoiding accidental use of modern JDK
APIs in code that will eventually interact with the legacy game process.

## Controlled laboratory milestone

The baseline remains:

```text
bootHeadless()
loadWorld(...)
tick(1)

vanilla oracle: MATCH
```

The repository preserves that official-JAR differential proof through 16 ticks
and adds a second evidence layer:

```text
snapshot() -> restore/replay -> compare(hypothesis A, hypothesis B)
                         |
                         +-> semantic GUI actions
                         +-> isolated B173Mod JAR
```

Checkpoint restoration is reconstruction plus deterministic event replay, not
heap serialization. This makes the state contract explicit and fail-closed.
The mod context is intentionally small so an Aero-specific adapter can be
introduced later without exposing mapped Minecraft classes to mod code.
